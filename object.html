    <p style="font-size: 200%;">Your main website objective is likely to be determined by what kind of business you have. For example, whether youâ€™re ecommerce, service-led, informative, etc. However, broadly speaking, typical website objectives include:


        To attract x amount of sales per month
        
        To attract x amount of enquiries per month
        
        To attract x amount of email list sign ups per month
        
        To attract x amount of followers on social media per month
        
        To boost store footfall by x amount of customers per month
        
        
        These are just a few ideas of what you may have started your website to accomplish. Of course, it could have been for any other reason not listed here. 
        
        The important thing to remember is that, in the beginning, you have to boil down your motivations for being online to one reason and one reason only. This will help maintain your focus on building a website that delivers on your primary objective. </p>
